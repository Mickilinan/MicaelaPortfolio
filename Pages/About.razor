                <p>
                    Ever since I jumped headfirst into the world of web development, I've been totally hooked on how
                    creative it is! Seriously, watching a project grow, from the first lines of code to the final look
                    on the screen, feels really awesome. Whether it's designing user-friendly stuff in the frontend or
                    building the logic behind the scenes in the backend, I love the process of turning ideas into
                    something real.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a junior web developer, I'm driven by my curiosity and always wanting to learn new things. You
                    could say I'm the kind of person who likes to ask "why?". <br>
                    I believe that being careful and able to analyze things are important when you write good code, and I'm 
                    not afraid to ask what might seem like a "silly" question. <br>During my internship at Akribian, I
                    learned so much about working in teams and using agile methods. Really digging into React and
                    TypeScript was a challenge that was actually a lot of fun. It really showed me how important it is
                    to work together to create cool stuff.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What about my future goals? Well, I'm super excited to use my growing skills in a team where I can
                    keep learning and growing. I'm looking forward to taking on new challenges, working with others on
                    exciting projects and in the end, building things that make a difference (even if it's in small
                    ways!).<br> I also want to stay up-to-date with all the new tech that's coming out – because let's be
                    honest, in this field, there's always something new and exciting to discover!
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I'm not coding , you'll probably find me enjoying nature and
                    animals. I really believe in having a good balance in life and for me that often means doing some
                    yoga, a bit of meditation or just letting loose and dancing.<br>
                    Who knew that finding your inner peace could also make you a more focused developer? Maybe it's the flexibility of mind – or maybe it's
                    just a good way to chill out after dealing with a stubborn bug!
                </p>
